    "In this project, I sought to find trends in data from schools in order to analyze if school budget, school type,  or school size, have any tendency to produce better scores from students in Math and Reading.\n",
    "My findings were that the budget did not affect performance, whereas School Type had a drastic effect. The top 5 performing schools were Charter schools and the bottom 5 were District schools. \n",
    "School size also had an affect on student performance. Large schools (over 2000 students) had a significantly lower passing rate of about 76%. Small schools (<1000) and Medium (1000-2000) schools both had around 95% passing rate. \n",
